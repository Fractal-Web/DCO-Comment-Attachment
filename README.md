# DCO Comment Attachment

DCO Comment Attachment allows your visitors to attach files with their comments, such as documents, images, videos, audios and others.

With plugin settings you can:
- Select an attachment image size from thumbnails available in your WordPress install.
- Limit the maximum file upload size.
- Make an attachment required.
- Specify whether the attachment will be embedded or displayed as a link.
- Restrict attachment file types.

Attachments are uploaded to the WordPress Media Library and deleted along with the comment (if this is set in the settings).
