# DCO Comment Attachment

DCO Comment Attachment allows your visitors to attach files with their comments, such as documents, images, videos, audios and others.

With plugin settings you can:
- Select an attachment image size from thumbnails available in your WordPress install.
- Limit the maximum file upload size.
- Make an attachment required.
- Specify whether the attachment will be embedded or displayed as a link.
- Restrict attachment file types.

You can also:
- Add, replace or delete an attachment from a comment on Edit Comment screen.
- Delete an attachment on Comments screen.

Attachments are uploaded to the WordPress Media Library and deleted along with the comment (if this is set in the settings).

DCO Comment Attachment is also available on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dco-comment-attachment/).
